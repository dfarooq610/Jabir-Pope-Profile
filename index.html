                Joseph Jabir Pope is 70 years old. He enjoys making music with his friends and writing poems to express his faith. He lives on the street he grew up on. But from his cognitive sharpness and lyrical flow, it's unlikely you would guess: Mr. Pope spent the last 38 years incarcerated for a crime judges and juries agree he did not commit.

        No offense of could to cats and kittens, but in my experience people more often want to showcase their dogs in my classes

            Most of the time when I teach HTML to a group of students, they make webpages about something they are interested in - 
            a band, recipe, place or something like that. People always have something to say, and love saying it to the public online.
