            <p> Joseph Jabir Pope is 70 years old. </p>

            <p>Born and raised in Boston, he lives with his siblings on the Roxbury street they grew up on. He's the father of one daughter and cares deeply about his community.</p>
                
            <p>But an unexpected twist in his 30s highlights a disparaging reality many  people in the U.S. face – Jabir spent 38 years incarcerated for a crime everyone, including judges and juries, agrees he did not commit.</p>

            <div class="step" data-step="1">
                <p>Jabir recently celebrated one year of freedom from serving a life sentence without parole.</p> 
            </div>
            <div class="step" data-step="2">
                <p>Following a re-hearing of his case, he was released from state prison in December 2021. And after justices concluded that police withheld information that could have helped his defense, the Massachusetts Supreme Court vacated Jabir's conviction the following summer.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step" data-step="3">
                <p>Nowadays, Jabir enjoys expressing himself through music and poetry. His mind is still sharp and his lyrical flow remains unchallenged. Some days, he invites his friends over to rehearse in the attic. They prefer the old school tunes.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step" data-step="4">
                <p>But his musical journey began long before his release. MORE TO COME</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step" data-step="5">
                <p>While incarcerated, Jabir wrote "My Father's World," a book dedicated to his daughter.</p>

        <div id="in-between">
            <h3>On the day of his release, Jabir insisted upon doing three things:</h3>
                <ul>1. Cashing a check</ul>
                <ul>2. Getting a cell phone</ul>
                <ul>3. Visiting the Masjid</ul>
            <p>But life, in spite of freedom, has not been without challenges.</p>
