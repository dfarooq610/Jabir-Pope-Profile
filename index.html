        <p>Joseph Jabir Pope is 70 years old.</p>
  
        <p>
          Born and raised in Boston, he lives with his siblings on the street they grew up on. He's a grandfather and the father of one daughter, and cares deeply about his community.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          But an unexpected twist in his 30s highlights a disparaging reality many
          people in the U.S. face – Jabir spent 38 years incarcerated for a crime
          everyone, including judges and juries, agrees he did not commit.

        <div class="step" data-step="1">

            Jabir recently celebrated one year of freedom from serving a life
            sentence without parole.

        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="2">
          <p>
            Following a re-hearing of his case, he was released from state
            prison in December 2021. After justices concluded police
            withheld information that could have helped his defense, the
            Massachusetts Supreme Court vacated Jabir's conviction the following
            summer.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="3">
          <p>
            Music has been a staple for Jabir for most of his life – a passion he is delving back into now that he's home. He grew up listening to quintessential 60s soul, citing the likes of Sam Cooke, The Temptations and The Dramatics as influences.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="4">
          <p>
            Since then, Jabir has become a bassist and a choreographer, as well as a vocalist in his group, The OGs. Members include a close friend and co-defendent Albert Brown in addition to rapper Jason Jiles, who is in the midst of fighting for his own freedom.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="5">
          <p>
            While his taste favors old soul, Jabir appreciates the cerebral and conscious side of hip-hop, particularly Tupac. The inspiration for his own art is similarly inspired – his songs cover topics as close-to-heart as his relationship with his daughter to celebratory ones for Kwanzaa.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="6">
          <p>
            But his talents also expand beyond music. While incarcerated, Jabir wrote "My Father's World," a book dedicated to his daughter, who was born at the start of his sentence. This past year, they've been inseparable.

          <p>On his day of release, Jabir knew he wanted to do three things:<br>
          Cash a check, get a cell phone and take a trip to the mosque.</p>

        <p>But life after release, in spite of freedom, has not been without its challenges. As one of the older exonerees in the NEIP network, Jabir faces unique obstacles post-release. Most of these are hidden in the tasks and tools that have become commonplace: navigating cell phones and his neighborhood, alike.

          <h3>From square one</h3>
          <p>The system doesn't currently offer much support to those it frees from wrongful conviction, leading people including Jabir to reconstruct everything they lost during incarceration by themselves.</p>

          <p>Jabir strives to be financially independent and wants to move into his own place – but finding the right job is difficult at 70 years old. <br><br>
            As he's gotten older, Jabir has also noticed his eyesight isn't as sharp. This limits his choice of employment and makes it harder to get his bearings with new technology.</p>
