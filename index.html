        <p>Joseph Jabir Pope is 70 years old.</p>
  
        <p>
          Born and raised in Boston, he lives with his siblings on the street they grew up on. He's a grandfather and the father of one daughter, and cares deeply about his community.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          But an unexpected twist in his 30s highlights a disparaging reality many
          people in the U.S. face - Jabir spent 38 years incarcerated for a crime
          everyone, including judges and juries, agrees he did not commit.

            Jabir recently celebrated one year of freedom from serving a life
            sentence without parole.

            Following a re-hearing of his case, he was released from state
            prison in December 2021. After justices concluded police
            withheld information that could have helped his defense, the
            Massachusetts Supreme Court vacated Jabir's conviction the following
            summer.

          <p>
            Jabir enjoys expressing himself through music and poetry – his mind is still sharp and his lyrical flow remains unchallenged. These days, he invites friends and fellow musicians over to rehearse in his attic. They prefer the old school tunes.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="4">
          <p>
            But his talents expand beyond music. While incarcerated, Jabir wrote "My Father's World," a book dedicated to his daughter.

      <h4>Rebuilding life after incarceration</h4>
      <p>But life after release, in spite of freedom, has not been without its challenges. Reconstructing life from the ground-up is Jabir's biggest obstacle after spending nearly four decades in prison and most of the challenges are hidden in plain sight.

          <p>Jabir strives to be financially independent and wants to move into his own place – but finding the right job is difficult at 70 years old.</p>

          <h3>Technology</h3>
          <p>As he's gotten older, Jabir has also noticed his eyesight isn't as sharp. This limits his choice of employment and makes it harder to get his bearings with new technology.</p>
