          Joseph Jabir Pope is 70 years old. Born and raised in Boston, he lives
          with his siblings on the street they grew up on. He's a father and
          grandfather, and cares deeply about his community.
        </p>

        <p>
          But an unexpected twist in his 30s highlights a disparaging reality
          many people in the U.S. face – Jabir spent 38 years incarcerated for a
          crime he did not commit.

            Jabir recently celebrated one year of freedom from serving a life
            sentence without parole.

            During that time, he devoted himself to winning his freedom and
            making a valuable contribution to his community from behind the
            walls, as well as to his child's life.

            Music has been a staple for Jabir for most of his life – a passion
            he is delving back into now that he's home. He grew up listening to
            quintessential 60s soul, citing the likes of Sam Cooke, The
            Temptations and The Dramatics as influences.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="4">
          <p>
            Since then, Jabir has become a bassist and a choreographer, as well
            as a vocalist in his group, The OGs. Members include a close friend
            and co-defendent Albert Brown in addition to rapper Jason Jiles, who
            is in the midst of fighting for his own freedom.

            While his taste favors old soul, Jabir appreciates the cerebral and
            conscious side of hip-hop, particularly Tupac. The inspiration for
            his own art is similarly inspired - his songs cover topics as
            close-to-heart as his relationship with his daughter to celebratory
            ones for Kwanzaa.
          </p>

        <div class="step" data-step="6">
          <p>
            But his talents also expand beyond music. In 1996, Jabir wrote "My
            Father's World," a book dedicated to his daughter, who was born at
            the start of his sentence. Since his release, they've been
            inseparable.

          <h2>Release, and Life After</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Pope, like many, turned to faith as a guiding light through
            difficult times to stay grounded and focused. Pope, after converting
            to Islam while in prison, was an activie member within in the Muslim
            community as an event coordinator. To him, studying Quran and going
            to the Masjid to pray are some of the small jewels that helps him
            navigate life. Faith provided him with guiding principles that he carried
            to the very day he was released.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the day he was released from prison, Pope wanted to do 3 things:
            go to the bank to cash a check, purchase a smartphone, and go to
            Masjid to pray. He was able to do all 3 things that day. He was able
            to cash his check, purchase a smartphone, and go to the Masjid to
            offer Sunnat prayer. The latter was a very special moment for him;
            he was heeding a piece of advice he gave for many fellow Muslims who
            were returning home after incarceration.
          </p>
          <p>
            But life after release, in spite of freedom, has not been without
            its challenges. As one of the older exonerees in the NEIP network,
            Jabir faces unique obstacles post-release. Most of these are hidden
            in the tasks and tools that have become commonplace: navigating cell
            phones and his neighborhood, alike.

            The system doesn't currently offer much support to those it frees
            from wrongful conviction, leading people including Jabir to
            reconstruct everything they lost during incarceration by themselves.

            Jabir strives to be financially independent and wants to move into
            his own place - but finding the right job is difficult at 70 years
            old. <br /><br />
            As he's gotten older, Jabir has also noticed his eyesight isn't as
            sharp. This limits his choice of employment and makes it harder to
            get his bearings with new technology.
